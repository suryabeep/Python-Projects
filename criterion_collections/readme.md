# Your Favorite Filmmaker's Favorite Films
'Art for Artists' is kind of hard to find. Maybe it's just me but I certainly have a hard time finding good examples. Luckily, the Criterion Collection asked a bunch of capital-A Artists what their favorite movies were, and posted their responses on its website. This simple python script collects all the movies mentioned, along with who chose them and how many times they were chosen. <br>

### Usage:
Run 'python3 main.py --count \<num>' where count is the cutoff for number of times a movie must be mentioned. Ex: Use count = 3 to only see movies that were mentioned 3 or more times. 

### Todo:
Convert this to use Selenium so I can scrape all the lists possible, not just the first one.
